# CMPSC465-Projec6
Takes a matrix and determines the size of the largest square of all 1's inside the matrix that is continuous

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing all 1's and return its area.

Input
Your program takes as input a file with multiple test cases separated by an empty line. Each test case starts
with a line with two integers indicating the size of the matrix in the test case, and is followed by lines of 0's
and 1's that form the matrix. The last line is a 0 meaning the end of test cases.

Output
Your program should output the area for the largest square of each test case in console
